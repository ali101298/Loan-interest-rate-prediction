# Loan interest rate prediction

This project aims to build several regression models, using R programming language, to predict the amount of interest rate a person can get based on certain factors and evaluate the models’ prediction results. The evaluation metric used to evaluate models' accuracy is Mean Squared Error (MSE). The loan data was retrieved from an AWS RDS (Amazon’s Cloud relational database).

The project code can be accessed through this link on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alizaminali/loan-interest-rate-prediction?scriptVersionId=165033255.
However, the project code can also be found in the "Loan interest rate prediction.ipynb" file in this repo.
